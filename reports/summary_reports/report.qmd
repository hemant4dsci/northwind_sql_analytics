# Project Overview

Northwind Analytics provides a comprehensive analysis of the Northwind company’s sales and operations data to uncover meaningful business insights. Using data from 11 interconnected areas — including customers, products, orders, suppliers, and employees — this project translates complex information into clear, actionable findings that support smarter decision-making.

The analysis focuses on identifying top-performing products, high-value customers, and key revenue regions, while also revealing opportunities to improve inventory efficiency, employee performance, and overall profitability.

By turning raw data into an easy-to-understand story about business performance, this project enables managers and stakeholders to make informed, evidence-based decisions that strengthen customer relationships, optimize operations, and drive sustainable growth.
